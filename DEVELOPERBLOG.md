**💩 Aufgeschoben: 4 hours**

Wanted to update the badges in the README file to show a nice status.
When I wanted to show the version numbers of the used packages, it did not show tham and showed the error "someting is wrong" over and over again. Only after quite some time, I discovered that the repository is set to "private". After changing it to public the badges worked.

- [#] Wasted quite some time to make them show up "nice".
- [#] Wasted quite some time to have links to GitHub and links to NPM with the used version number, read from the package.json of the project.

> [!NOTE] Private repository
>
> A big issue in the last hours was that the @kuvali-js/core repository was private.
> Changed it to public and it worked.

## ConnectivityService 

- [#] Focus: create jest tests for ConnectivityService & fix some bugfixes
- [#] check hook for status change online  -> offline
- [#] check hook for status change offline -> online
- [#] some more basic High Level tests.
- [#] added Unsubscribe Pattern to ConnectivityService event functions.

All tests are green and uncovered even some (minor) bugs in the code.
Mostly writing the mocks and events were the problem today. :-(

> Application and tests are working.
  
Was a successful day. still worked on ConnectivityService and not on Supaebase/Auth/Log.
